# Security Architecture

## Overview

This AWS MCP server implements a **forced permission model** where the AI client MUST handle permissions correctly. The server enforces this through separate tools for read vs write operations.

## Architecture

### Two-Tool Design

**execute_aws_read_command**
- Only accepts read-only commands (describe, list, get, show, etc.)
- Validates commands against read-only prefix list
- Executes immediately without any approval
- Tool description signals to AI that no permission is needed

**execute_aws_write_command**
- Only accepts write commands (create, delete, update, modify, etc.)
- Validates that commands are NOT read-only
- Tool description signals to AI that approval is ALWAYS required
- Executes immediately (no server-side blocking)

### Command Classification

Commands are classified using extensive prefix matching:

```python
read_only_prefixes = [
    "describe", "list", "get", "show", "view", "ls", "head",
    "ec2 describe", "s3 ls", "s3 head", "s3api list", "s3api get",
    "iam list", "iam get", "rds describe", "lambda list", "lambda get",
    # ... and many more
]
```

### Validation Logic

1. **Read Tool**: Rejects commands that are NOT in the read-only list
2. **Write Tool**: Rejects commands that ARE in the read-only list
3. **Error Messages**: Guide users to use the correct tool

## AI Client Behavior

### Expected Behavior

**Claude Desktop & VS Code Copilot:**
- See `execute_aws_read_command` → execute without prompting
- See `execute_aws_write_command` → prompt user for approval
- This is enforced by the tool naming and descriptions

### Failure Modes

**If AI tries to use wrong tool:**
- Server validates and returns error message
- Guides AI to use correct tool
- Prevents accidental permission bypasses

**If AI client ignores tool descriptions:**
- Tool naming makes intent clear
- MCP protocol enforces tool selection
- Server-side validation provides final safety net

## Security Properties

### Guaranteed Properties

1. **No Permission Bypasses**: Server validates all commands
2. **Clear Intent**: Tool names force explicit read/write choice
3. **Fail-Safe**: Wrong tool usage results in error, not execution
4. **Audit Trail**: All commands are logged with their intended purpose

### Defense in Depth

1. **Tool Naming**: Makes AI intent explicit
2. **Tool Descriptions**: Guide AI client behavior
3. **Server Validation**: Prevents misclassification
4. **Command Classification**: Extensive read-only pattern matching

## Implementation Benefits

### For AI Clients
- Clear guidance on when to prompt
- No ambiguity about command intent
- Consistent behavior across different AI systems

### For Users
- Predictable permission behavior
- Read operations never interrupt workflow
- Write operations always require explicit approval
- No hidden server-side configuration

### For Security
- Cannot be disabled or bypassed
- Enforced at the protocol level
- Transparent and auditable
- Minimal attack surface

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Version

Old usage:
```json
{"tool": "execute_aws_command", "arguments": {"command": "s3 ls"}}
```

New usage:
```json
{"tool": "execute_aws_read_command", "arguments": {"command": "s3 ls"}}
```

### For AI Clients

AI clients should:
1. Use `execute_aws_read_command` for read operations
2. Use `execute_aws_write_command` for write operations
3. Always prompt before using `execute_aws_write_command`
4. Never prompt for `execute_aws_read_command`

This architecture ensures consistent, secure behavior across all MCP clients while maintaining a smooth user experience.
